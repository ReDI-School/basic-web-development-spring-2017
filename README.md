# Curriculum

Curriculum in html. Each lesson is one html file, and each slide
within it is a section. There is a little JavaScript that gives them
ids and makes them switchable by clicking the left and right arrow
keys. Example html:

```html
<section>
  <h1>Slide title</h1>
  <p>Slide body</p>
</section>
<section>
  ...
</section>
```

The lesson files are deliberately not numbered, so that the order can
be changed later by rearranging their links in the index.html. Each
lesson file should contain enough material to fill exactly one
teaching unit, so that a class can be teached without having to switch
between different lesson files.
