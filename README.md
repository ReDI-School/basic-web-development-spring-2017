# Curriculum

Curriculum in html. Each lesson is one html file, and each slide
within it is a section with an id with the slide number, e.g.

```html
<section id="slide-1">
  <h1>Slide title</h1>
  <p>Slide body</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-2">
  ...
</section>
```

The lesson files are deliberately not numbered, so that the order can
be changed later by rearranging their links in the index.html. Each
lesson file should contain enough material to fill exactly one
teaching unit, so that a class can be teached without having to switch
between different lesson files.
